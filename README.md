## My Home Website

This isn't a professional website.  It's just a place I can add a few things that are fun for me/my family.

## Permissions

This site isn't meant to be commercially viable in any way.  If you want to use any ideas from it, I don't care, but I'm not responsible for anything you choose to use.  It's built on Laravel which is secure by default, but it's entirely possible I did something to make it less secure in this instance.  Feel free to use it as a toy, it's not put together to be anything mroe than that.

## License

In case it keeps me out of trouble for someone not realizing this site is just a toy, this software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
